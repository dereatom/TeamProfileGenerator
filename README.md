# TeamProfileGenerator

# Project Description

The App was built a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so it also write a unit test for every part of code and ensure that it passes each test.

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated

# The app contains
A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the Team Profile Generator and passing tests was submitted, how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application, how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application and finally how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application.

# Techniques and Technologies Used
>use Jest for running the unit tests and Inquirer for collecting input from the user.This app uses concepts from Test-Driven Development. Jest is used to perform tests on all the class constructors to ensure that they behave as expected.
>The FS node module is used to generate an HTML file from strings written in JavaScript.
